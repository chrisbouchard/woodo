This project is best illustrated by an example:

``` ShellSession
% woodo
It's a weird tree.
% sudo woodo
Password: ••••••••
    _              __
   / `\  (~._    ./  )
   \__/ __`-_\__/ ./
  _ \ \/  \   \ |_   __
(   )  \__/ -^    \ /  \
 \_/ "  \  | o  o  |.. /  __
      \. --' ====  /  || /  \
        \   .  .  |---__.\__/
        /  :     /   |   |
        /   :   /     \_/
     --/ ::    (
    (  |     (  (____
  .--  .. ----**.____)
  \___/
```

That's about it. Thank [/r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1yy1c4/sudo_woodo/) for the inspiration. I wrote it as a shell script because I don't like running arbitrary C code as root.
